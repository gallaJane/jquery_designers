  <h1>The Document Object Model (DOM)</h1>
  <p>As essential skill to writing jQuery is having a solid understanding of the <em>Document Object Model</em>, or the <em>DOM</em>. The DOM helps us understand the semantics of interfaces and objects, and the relationships between them.  Everything in a <em>document</em> is represented by a <em>node</em> in the DOM.</p>
  <p>Using jQuery's <em>.ready()</em> event ensures our code runs only after the DOM has been rendered by the browser.</p>
  
  <script>
 $(document).ready( function() {
     
 
 
 }); /*close the ready event */
    
  </script>
